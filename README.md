## Election-Audit Summary
  For any other election, a new set of data will obviously be introduced for Python to process. An example for diving deeper int the data, add another subset of data for major cities within the counties. Maybe add another for loop, much like the county_name for loop, of data from the cities to see how much of a percentage the cities get versus rural areas. Another idea for the data collected would be to analyze the amoung of votes each candidate got within each county. That could see which counties supported which candidates the most. Candidates could use this information to maybe work on their campaigning within these areas.
